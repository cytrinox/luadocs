## Name

cr2hdr.lua - Magic Lantern Dual ISO processing

## Description

cr2hdr Magic Lantern Dual ISO processing.

This script automates the steps involved to process an image created
with the Magic Lantern Dual ISO module. Upon invoking the script with a
shortcut "cr2hdr" provided by Magic Lantern is run on the selected
images. The processed files are imported. They are also made group
leaders to hide the original files.


## Usage

* start this script using script manager
* trigger conversion on selected/hovered images by shortcut (set shortcut in settings dialog)
* it is also possible to have the script run after importing a collection (optin, since it is not that fast)
